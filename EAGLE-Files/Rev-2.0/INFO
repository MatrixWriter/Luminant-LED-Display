Project Name: Luminant Display
Revision: 2.0
Revision Date: 3/28/2014
Original Engineer: JP Allport
Additional Engineering: Beeta Modarressi and John Nolan
Manufacturing and Assembly: Made in the USA

This project was created using EAGLE CAD Pro.  If you have the nonprofessional version, you cannot view the design as the PCB board dimensions are unsupported.
Gerber files will be provided shortly that was submitted to fabrication as a well as images of the project.

This is an high density LED board where LED components have a spacing of 70 mils between each package.
Due to the vast amount of components and the spacing, this board underwent automated assembly - it is not recommended to hand assemble the board.

This board uses dual Teensy 3.1 microcontrollers to control all of the LEDs.  Pin 12 syncs both of them together. 
While one single Teensy 3.1 is capable of controlling the entire display, two were used as it would increase the output frame rate and be able to hand more LEDs.

Here are the specifications:
Total number of LEDs (WS2812B): 1920
Total number of capacitors (0805, 0.1 uF): 1920
Board width (dimension X):  22.00 inch
Board length (dimension Y): 9.95 inch
SMDs on both sides: Yes
Number of SMD pads on top: 7682
Number of SMD pads on bottom: 3896
Number of thru hole packages: 47
Smallest hole size: 10 mil
Smallest SMD pitch: 8 il

Fabrication specification:
Copper weight: 2.0 oz
Board material: 370 HR
Board thickness: 0.093 inch
Soldermask color: White
Silkscreen color: Black

Additional notes:
1) 100 Ohm 1206 SMD resistors are used on the 74HCT245 buffer to help with signal integrity from the output signals of the Teensy 3.1.
2) Large filtering capacitors (3500 uF) have been added to the power input to reduce ripple and to prevent burning out of the LEDs during first power up.

Known issues with Revision 2.0 and to be fixed in next revision:
1) The tooling/mounting holes are not consistent in the X dimension
2) Additional stitching GND vias need to be added to improve copper pour and GND plane response
3) The name of the board needs to be changed from Lumia Display (Gerber files) to Luminant Display (fixed)
4) Additional pin outs should be added to the Teensy 3.1 for user expandability
5) +5V Dir connection needs to be removed (no longer needed) and routed directly to the 74HCT245 buffer
6) Optional 0.1 uF to the 74HCT245 buffer silkscreening needs to be relabeled
7) High frequency filtering capacitors on power input package needs to be increased
