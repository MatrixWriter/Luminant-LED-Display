Luminant Display is designed using EAGLE PCB Professional version.
You must have a paid version of EAGLE to view the files unfortunately.

This is due to the large PCB size that the free version of EAGLE does not support
However, schematics and board layout images will be uploaded.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
